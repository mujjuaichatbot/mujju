#   India's First Autonomous and Cognitive AI Chatbot - Mujju

> “Unlike GPT, Mujju doesn’t just answer — it self learn , verifies, correct its analysis if needed and explains autonomously”

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Meet **Mujju**, the chatbot. It’s not just another bot — it's **India's first autonomous, cognitive AI system** that:
- Learns from documents (like PDFs)
- Reflects on its own knowledge
- Performs real-time research
- Continuously adapts and improves

Built using a hybrid of rule-based logic, knowledge graphs, NLP, and **autonomous Wikipedia exploration**, MujjuBot can:
- 📥 Learn from PDFs
- 🧠 Conduct reasoning
- ✔️ Verify facts
- 🔁 Self-correct errors
- 📈 Grow smarter with every interaction
